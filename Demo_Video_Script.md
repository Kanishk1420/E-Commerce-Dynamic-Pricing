## üî¨ **SOLUTION OVERVIEW** *(18-35 seconds)*

**[Screen: Show the analysis workflow - sections 1-4 quickly, then focus on key visualizations]**

**Narrator (confident, technical but accessible):**
*"My approach combines advanced analytics with business intelligence. First, I cleaned and integrated the data, then engineered smart features like price positioning and seasonal patterns. The core innovation? Price elasticity analysis - understanding exactly how customers respond to price changes across different product categories."*

**[Screen: Show elasticity heatmap and demand curves]**

*"Some products like 'Set' and 'Top' categories are price-insensitive - perfect for margin expansion. Others like 'Western Dress' are highly elastic - ideal for volume-driven strategies."*
